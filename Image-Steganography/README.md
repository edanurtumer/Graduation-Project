# Android Based Image Hiding, Encryption and Messaging Application

It is difficult to reach important information due to the high number of students in schools and reaching hundreds of thousands. In order for teachers to access information more easily, the data on the picture will be hidden and encrypted so that they can be accessed more easily. Later, data sharing between teachers will be possible through messaging.

Firebase database is used.

# Image Steganography
Steganography is the process of hiding a secret message within a larger one in such a way that someone  cannot know the presence or contents of the hidden message. Although related, teganography is not to be confused with Encryption, which is the process of aking message unintelligible—Steganography attempts to hide the existence of communication.
The main advantage of steganography algorithm is because of its simple security mechanism. Because the steganographic message is integrated invisibly and covered inside other harmless sources, it is very difficult to detect the message without knowing the existence and the appropriate encoding scheme .

Help was taken from this github account (https://github.com/aagarwal1012/Image-Steganography-Library-Android) for the steganography part of this project.

# Purpose of the Project: 
Teachers are in contact with more students in terms of number. It can be difficult to access students' information sometimes. The purpose of the application is to give the teacher the chance to access the information of the student he/she wants anywhere, under any condition. Teachers are provided with a private space with user login. The ability of the teacher to reach the student's information is within the distance of a phone. Necessary data transfer can also be done easily through the application. A secure environment will be provided by encrypting student pictures and the information hidden in it. In this way, we both achieve our goal of accessing data quickly and ensure data security.

# Importance of the Project:
The importance of the application is that the institutions that are in contact with many people can sometimes have difficulties in reaching their contact information. In order to reach the data they want, teachers will be able to enter the application and call the student's picture and click on the student's picture. Later on, they will be able to write the necessary information without searching in other files. In this way, data access is provided very easily. Time is not lost. Although it is thought of as a university environment, it is the same in these hospitals. Although it is currently limited to universities only, it can be done for other institutions as well.
